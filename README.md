# macOS Scientific Calculator Clone

This is a web-based clone of the macOS Scientific Calculator built using React. The calculator includes all basic arithmetic operations, advanced functions like trigonometry, logarithms, exponents, and special functions (e.g., factorial, random number). It also features a responsive design that mimics the look and feel of the macOS Scientific Calculator.

## Features

- Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Advanced functions: sine, cosine, tangent, logarithms, exponents, square roots, factorial, random number generation, and switching between degrees and radians.
- Ability to handle multiple operations and parentheses (order of operations).
- Confetti explosion for specific operations involving 3 and 4 as operands.
- Toggle between primary and secondary functions.
